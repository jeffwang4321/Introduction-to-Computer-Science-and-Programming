# Final Project: Plants Vs Aliens
- Collaborated in a team of two to build a game application about planets and aliens. The users are able to customize their planet settings and collect rock specimens with aliens. 
- The data system was programmed in Python, using strings and lists to contain fuel levels, rock specimens, alien statistics and planet positions.
- The visuals were coded using Python's builtin **turtle** feature which enhanced the gaming experision and player immersion.
- Final debugging tests were conducted manually via trial and error to ensure the data system was functionally correct.
